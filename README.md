## EDA:
### Testing Assumptions
1. How do Economic and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores correlate with Stock Prices?
2. What are the trends in stock prices and trading volumes over time across various sectors?
3. Which sector are most sensitive to specific economic indicators such as employment rates, the Human Development Index (HDI), and the Producer Price Index (PPI)?

## Predictive Analysis:
1. Which among the select features, including average hourly earnings, Producer Price Index (PPI), corporate governance risk, Employment Cost Index, environmental risk, Human Development Index (HDI), interest rates, labor productivity, payroll employment, rolling means, social risk, stock price data, unemployment rates, and volume of trades, predict stock price, and how does the identified predictors vary in their predictive power across different sectors?
2. Which machine learning models perform relatively better in predicting future stock prices using the select features?
3. Do different preprocessing techniques impact the accuracy of machine learning models as it relates to stock price prediction, and which predictors are effective in estimating the stock performance?
